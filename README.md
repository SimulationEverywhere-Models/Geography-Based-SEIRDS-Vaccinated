Cell-DEVS Geographical SEIRDS Pandemic Model
===
Overview
----
This model is an extension of a previous SIRDS model found here:
https://github.com/SimulationEverywhere-Models/Geography-Based-SEIRDS

The inital model was based on the Zhong model:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088542/pdf/11430_2009_Article_44.pdf

<!-- Documentation
----
See the `Manual.docx` file located at the root of this repository, `Geographical SEIRDS COVID-19 Model.pdf`, and the README files in folders -->

Requirements
---
* A C++17 compiler (GCC was used for development)
* A copy of this repository
* A copy of Cadmium (master), available at https://github.com/SimulationEverywhere/cadmium
* Python 3, Python packages geopandas, numpy, matplotlib
* Java Runtime Environment

The following commands can be used to get cadmium:

1. git clone https://github.com/SimulationEverywhere/cadmium.git

2. cd cadmium

3. git submodule update --init --recursive

The dependencies for cadmium must also be installed. Refer to the document located at:

http://www.sce.carleton.ca/courses/sysc-5104/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=cadmium.pdf


The location of cadmium must be in the parent folder that holds this project, or the directory directly above.

If the location of this cloned repository has the location of `parentFolder/GeographicalModel`, then the cadmium library should be located in parentFolder.

Alternatively if the location of this cloned repository has the location of `parentFolder/projectsFolder/GeographicalModel`, then the cadmium library should be located in parentFolder.

Compiling the Program
----
**Using CMAKE**
1. Navigate to the root directory of the copy of this project
2. Enter the following command `cmake CMakeLists.txt`
3. Execute the make file using the command: make

Run All .sh Scripts
----
This project contains a number of utilities that can work in sequence. The scripts run_ontario_phu.sh and run_ottawa_das.sh generate a scenario from data, run the model, and processes the output, and can be modified as needed to run scenarios automatically.
The .sh scripts does:

1. Generates a cell space from geographical data, initializes infection in a single cell.
2. Runs a simulation with the generated scenario
3. Generates SEIRD graphs of the simulation (saved in logs folder)
4. Converts the message log of the simulation into standard web viewer format (messages.log), generates structure.json, and saves the result in the GIS_Viewer folder

Generating a scenario from geographical data
----
A scenario.json is generated by running generate_ontario_phu_json.py or generate_ottawa_da_json.py

1. Open a terminal and navigate to /Geography-Based-Model/Scripts/Input_Generator
2. Edit scenario inputs in the script's input folder folder (default.json, fields.json, infectedCell.json) as desired
3. Enter the following command `python generate_ontario_phu_json.py` or  `python generate_ottawa_da_json.py`


Running a Model
----

To run the model:
1. Create a directory called logs in the root directory of this project (if one does not already exist)
2. Go to the bin folder from the root directory
3. Enter the following command:

`./pandemic-geographical_model <configuration_file_path>/scenario.json [<simulation time>]`

The last parameter is optional. The default is 500.

Viewing Results in GIS Web Viewer V2
---
The most recent version of the GIS Web Viewer can be found at http://206.12.94.204:8080/arslab-web/1.3/app-gis-v2/index.html

Upload a simulation's geojson, messages.log, structure.json, visualization.json to view simulation results. See GIS_Viewer folder README for more details

Downloading geopandas
---
This project uses several python scripts that are dependent on the libraries: geopandas, numpy, and matplotlib. geopandas requires specific versions of many dependent libraries and installing them manually is difficult. The easiest way to download the right packages is to use conda. It is also recommended to install these packages in a seperate conda environment. Attemping to install in conda base may fail.
1. https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
2. select 64-Bit (x86) Installer (Linux)
3. run the .sh installer, recommended default settings
4. open a terminal and activate conda if not already active
5.  ```conda create --name geo_env```
6.  ```conda activate geo_env```
7.  ```conda install geopandas numpy matplotlib ```
